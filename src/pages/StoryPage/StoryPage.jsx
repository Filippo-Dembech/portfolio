                            Back in the day, I was working for my dad. My job
                            was to manage his company's documentation and keep
                            track of all the important deadlines. I spent a lot
                            of time in Excel.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            One day, while I was sorting and filtering a table,
                            something unusual caught my eye: the{" "}
                            <strong>Developer Tab</strong>.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            For those who don't know, it's a hidden section in
                            Excel where you can write simple programs for your
                            spreadsheets (basically complex macrosâ€”using VBA). I
                            realized I could even build custom interfaces and
                            make the spreadsheets interactive for users. That
                            moment opened up an entirely new world for me:{" "}
